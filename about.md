# About

Today, many widgets on the web platform are specific to their frameworks and do not interoperate with other frameworks. Web Components have the potential to create a new, compatible ecosystem of components that will make it easier for developers to build capable, well-designed web applications. 

However, this compatibility is not a foregone conclusion. The community needs to develop the best practices organically--documenting the cowpaths so that others can follow, making it more likely that someday those cowpaths can become highways.

WebComponents.org is where pioneers and community-members of the Web Components ecosystem (like Polymer, X-tags, and other interested parties) document web components best practices so that others can follow the same path instead of needlessly striking out on their own. Over time, the site may develop to have more features, like a component registry.
