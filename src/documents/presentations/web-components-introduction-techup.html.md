During this talk I will convey to you the significance of using Web Components and explain why web developers need them. I'll talk about the state of browser compatibility and how to use Web Components in browsers that are not compatible. I'll demonstrate to you how to use Web Components and explain how they work. A significant part of this talk is about creating your own Web Components, which I'll compliment with live coding examples.

To fully understand this talk the attendees should have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After the talk all attendees will get a link to download the slides and source files from the live coding examples.
