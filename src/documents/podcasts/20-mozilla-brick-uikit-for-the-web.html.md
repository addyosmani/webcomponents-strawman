Matt Claypotch, Mozilla Apps Engineer & Lead on Mozilla Brick Project and Soledad Penades,
GIF Hacktivist & Mozilla Apps Engineer, join The Web Platform Podcast to talk about building
UI focused Web Components for the 'Mobile First' Web Development. Mozilla Brick is a set of
'Mobile First' focused Web Components built as close to the specs as possible. It is not a
library built on top of Web Components like Polymer, it is a collection of elements with as
little abstraction as possible. Brick's goal has been to make building the interface of web
applications easier. UI is not as easy for many developers to build from scratch and it can be
difficult to get performant, usable, and attractive widgets.
