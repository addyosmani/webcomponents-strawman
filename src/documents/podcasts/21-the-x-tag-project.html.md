Daniel Buchner, Product Manager at Target & former Mozillian, talks with
The Web Platform Podcast on x-tag, the Custom Elements library competitor
to Polymer that he created alongside former Mozillian & Kraken Developer,
Arron Schaar.

<!-- Excerpt -->

<p>
X-tag is a interesting way to work with web components that
takes a totally imperative approach to creating Web Components as opposed
to the declarative way of building with Polymer. Some features include
legacy browser support, optional mixins to share across components, &
functional pseudos to assist in delegation.
