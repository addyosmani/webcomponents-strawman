Steve Faulkner of The Paciello Group and Marcy Sutton from Substantial discuss the lack of focus in product development
today with regards to building accessible applications & services. Many times web accessibility becomes an afterthought in
creating a software product, having little prioritization from the business side until it is a problem. Retrofitting such
an important part of our development can make web accessibility seem more like a chore with low ROI for the the time taken
to implement it. It can be easy if developers know how to do it and hardly any work when it is successfully incorporated
into a development process and itâ€™s valued at the business level.

In many client side frameworks there is a growing focus on componentization in the form of  HTML elements. Some examples
are Angular Directives, Ember Components, and React Classes. Web Components, a low level set of native web technologies,
give developers a chance to build better Web Accessibile components. Using various tools like WAI ARIA roles at a more focused
& reusable level, Web Components may just be the future of accessibility on the web.
