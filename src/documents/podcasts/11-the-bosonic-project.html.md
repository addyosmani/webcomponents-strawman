Raphael Rougeron joins The Web Platform Podscast from Toulouse, France to talk about The Bosonic Project.
Raphael and his team of developers mostly focus their development efforts working in the Financial Industry,
building out secure and robust applications as well as intricate cross browser UI Components.

<!-- Excerpt -->

<p>
The UI components part of his work is especially interesting in that it led him to create The Bosonic Project, an
alternative type of Web Components library that takes a different approach than Polymer or x-Tag.
